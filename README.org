A literate emacs configuration using ~org-mode~ with ~babel~.

Package management courtesy of the wonderful combination of [[https://github.com/cask/cask][cask]] and [[https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet][pallet]].

* Installation

** Linux

If you're on linux and want my configuration, just clone the contents of this repository into ~\~/.emacs.d~, and run ~install.sh~ (do this at your own risk).

** TODO Add windows installation instructions
